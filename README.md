Thanks to JavaScript Mastery's [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZBCUegTZF7M?si=Whq0Tl7VqPPd5Rxt), I am learning React Native by building a Full Stack React Native App.
In this app, we implement many functionalities that are used in most apps:
+ sign up, sign in, log in, log out
+ see latest posts
+ search post
+ bookmark posts
+ create post and file uploading
+ profile screen
+ tab navigation


Styling is done using NativeWind; I had never used Tailwind CSS before so it was nice discovering it.
Data is stored in Appwrite.
